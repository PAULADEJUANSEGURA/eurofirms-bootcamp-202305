## General description of the application

It is going to be a social network to find users with the same taste in music. Users are allowed to register and select the styles of music that they like and also select the bands of musicians that they like the most between the list that we suggest. After that process, our application will show the people registered with the same taste in music. You could see the users that had selected the same styles of music and also the bands and then is when you could see their pictures and you could choose with who you want to have a match and you can start to see the post of the people that you have selected as favourite to be your future friends.
